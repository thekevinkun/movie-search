should have followed the cheap and cheerful vibe of the 1973 movie. At least that was fun! This series suffers the post millennial habit of taking itself far too seriously ( think of the Daniel Craig Bond films) to the point that it becomes a chore to watch.\r\n\r\nThe 1973 movie starring Yul Brynner and Richard Benjamin got everything right.

Different characters react according to their personalities.   To Dr. Ford  (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who keeps a copy of Michelangelo's CREATION OF ADAM in his office, it is the creation of a new species.  To Bernard Lowe, it is a fascinating experiment to take his mind off personal tragedy.  To the pompous writer Sizemore, it is a new artform as he composes narratives for the robots to carry out.  To visitors William and Logan it is wish-fulfillment, whether it is William's search for love or Logan's vulgar thrill-seeking.  To Theresa, it is just a business, and she complains that Dr. Ford's attempts to making robots more lifelike and unpredictable will eat into profits.   The robots themselves, who are supposedly rebooted after each \"show\", aren't supposed to think or feel anything -- but they are starting to do so. \r\n\r\nThe show has numerous artistic references -- Dr. Ford's Michelangelo painting, the logo parodying Da Vinci's \"Vitruvian Man\" drawing,  Debussy's REVERIE, plus references to old-fashioned Westerns.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to see a show where there is attention paid to character and ideas as well as action.","created_at":"2017-04-05T14:07:27.021Z","id":"58e4fa1f92514127e802f772","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:56.267Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58e4fa1f92514127e802f772"},{"author":"Dean","author_details":{"name":"Dean","username":"Ditendra","avatar_path":"/pbZ9zJZEVYmtmjOZHPRvnnYxqYt.png","rating":4},"content":"I don't understand this TV show got such a big ratings.

Westworld is one of HBO's biggest/best series, and in my opinion, it's the one that currently occupies the throne that GOT ruled for years. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy created an extremely complex narrative, filled with mind-blowing twists, and truly remarkable character-building. Season three promised to be totally different, having in mind last season's game-changing finale, so expectations are undoubtedly very high...\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that Westworld packs jaw-dropping twists, the previous seasons differ from one another concerning this aspect. In season one, the twists serve the story, but in the second one, it felt like the story was serving the twists. This resulted in a few \"less great\" episodes due to the loss of tension and of well-balanced pacing, occasionally losing the interest of its viewers. In addition to this, most twists were so foreshadowed that the last few episodes lacked that powerful punch to knock us out.\r\n\r\nSeason three goes back to basics. Last season's finale works almost like a reboot of the series regarding its environment, rules, and even characters. Most of the series is set in the real world so far, but there are a few sequences in familiar places. Dolores' plan seems simple, but since this is Westworld, the last half of the season will probably provide a few surprises, so keep your eyes wide open.\r\n\r\nI can't really delve into what each character is doing, but according to the trailers, writing that Bernard and Maeve have an essential role in this season shouldn't come as a shock. Both possess two very intriguing arcs, and I'm definitely interested in knowing how they will connect to Dolores' storyline. Aaron Paul's Caleb doesn't have that much screentime in the first four episodes. Nevertheless, he receives a well-written backstory, and his subplot not only tells the audience everything about him, but it also shows how the real world works.\r\n\r\nMy biggest compliment to the first half of this season is about each episode's structure. Every single episode starts and ends with something impactful. Each time I started one, I was instantly captivated by what was happening, and every ending left me with an extreme curiosity to watch the next one. Fortunately, I had the \"next episode\" button, but it will definitely be interesting to see how fans will react to weeks of waiting for the next (great) episode. Throughout each chapter, the story flows naturally without those confusing, exaggerated, twistful narratives of season two.\r\n\r\nSo far, it's a pretty straightforward main plot, but the unsolved mysteries still carry that aura of unpredictability, which makes season three a perfect structure to deliver a phenomenal, shocking finale. The acting continues to be top-notch with everyone just giving their all. So far, my standouts are Tessa Thompson (Charlotte Hale) and Evan Rachel Wood. Ed Harris (William) also delivers an outstanding display, but the two women are unbelievably good, especially Thompson. Technically, the episodes were still a work in progress, but the production and visual quality of HBO are impressive as always.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Westworld returns with a perfect season's structure to blow every fan's mind away once again. The real world looks incredible, every character gets a very intriguing story, but the first and last few minutes of each episode are absolutely fantastic. Each chapter instantly grabs the viewer's attention, and the ending leaves everyone craving for the next episode. Tessa Thompson is the absolute standout, but Evan Rachel Wood continues to prove her impressive acting skills. Aaron Paul should have more screentime in the last half of the season, but so far, both he and Caleb are pretty great. Excellent pacing, brilliant tension-building regarding the central mystery, and wonderfully-written dialogues. Four episodes, nothing truly negative to point out.
