As the plot thickens, we find out that power struggle between the groups has been ingrained in everyone for generations. You may even say it's been institutionalized since the community's inception. \r\n\r\nPeople can read into this however they want; what really matters is if it works or not.  Given that the kids are literally werewolves, sirens, medusas and other cryptid creatures of lore, it is my opinion if you feel this dynamic is only in place to make you feel fragile, than you need  to (in the words of my grandfather) 'get a tougher skin'.  Honestly, it's a TV show, are you that wounded?\r\n\r\nAs these kids are in fact literally and physically outcasts to our society, their struggles being so and trying to fit in work in this story.  I believe because Wednesday isn't physically a cryptid people expected something else.  She's always been, along with her whole family obviously not normal and thus outcasts like the rest. \r\n\r\nWhat I really enjoyed about this is the dynamic between Jenna and the un-talking member of the Adams' family, Thing (physically played by **Victor Dorobantu**).  The actor wears a green suite except for his hand and contorts his way through every scene. The result is a way more realistic human hand running around than any CGI could have ever done. I also love the duplicity between Wednesday and her trying-to-be / would-be warewolf roommate, Endid (joyfully played by **Emma Myers**).  There are honestly quite a few very likeable supporting characters that make the gloom and doom (that I love) from the main character and balance it into something even more plateable. \r\n\r\nIf your nostalgic for the kooky family, the show has plenty of fan service that isn't too blatant (at least not for everything all the time). You get the finger snaps, you get Christina Ricci (for those 90's kids fans), and you get a pretty accurate Adams Family as compared to the original source material. \r\n\r\nI believe the plots mystery will keep people engaged enough (it's no Knives Out or Glass Onion), but combine that with the strength of the characters and you get a really great TV show worth re-watching;  which is personally one of the highest praise I can put on a TV series.  Highly recommended!","created_at":"2023-01-10T15:30:20.045Z","id":"63bd848cfc31d300a8df6ea2","updated_at":"2023-01-10T16:07:35.457Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63bd848cfc31d300a8df6ea2"},{"author":"ProPriyam","author_details":{"name":"","username":"ProPriyam","avatar_path":null,"rating":4},"content":"One of those hard to endure type fantasy shows.
