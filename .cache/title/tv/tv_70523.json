Coworkers recommended me to watch it. Dark has quite good reputation and rating on the Internet as well. So, I started watching. Watched whole first season and now started second one and all I can say it's very slow, confusing and uninteresting. Characters are boring and shallow, plot is also very simple and uninteresting - just about time travelling. Some characters jump from present to past or future and that's it. There's no tense or anything that would leave you attached to it, having a desire to watch episode after episode. I can't wait when second season ends, so this boredom ends. The only thing I like about this TV show is it's main soundtrack.","created_at":"2019-08-26T13:06:32.014Z","id":"5d63d9587f6c8d6d93ec4aa3","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:25.966Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d63d9587f6c8d6d93ec4aa3"},{"author":"J.

Everyone in town has dark secrets they are hiding. The lights flicker, dead birds fall from the sky and there is something unusual in the caves out in the forest. \r\nAll the weird stuff going on is similar to events that took place back in 1986 and even before that in 1953 in Winden. \r\nAs both the towns and residents secrets are revealed, the story takes on a truly sinister and disturbing outcome. \r\n\r\nPersonal opinion:\r\n\r\nThis show is full of mystery, secrets, suspense and even time travel. It has a Stranger Things vibe to it, but more of an adult version with a time traveling aspect instead of a monster from another dimension. Every episode will have you on the edge of your seat and contains clues to what is to come. \r\nA shocking truth is revealed in episode #5 and things only spiral more out of control from there. There are many cheating couples and lots of getting it on, especially in the first season. While I was able to guess the strangers identity before it was revealed, most clues are well hidden and hard to catch unless you rewatch after finishing. \r\nThe second season ends with a huge cliffhanger that has me anxiously waiting for a season 3. \r\nDark is definitely a binge worthy show worth checking out!","created_at":"2020-01-23T14:33:49.019Z","id":"5e29aecd98f1f10018f62f3e","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:33.364Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5e29aecd98f1f10018f62f3e"}],"recommendations":[{"backdrop_path":"/sNtNXwtEbdw4LaCFxFQwL2Jv4yW.jpg","id":72844,"name":"The Haunting of Hill House","original_name":"The Haunting of Hill House","overview":"The Crains, a fractured family, confront haunting memories of their old home and the terrifying events that drove them from it.","poster_path":"/38PkhBGRQtmVx2drvPik3F42qHO.jpg","media_type":"tv","adult":false,"original_language":"en","genre_ids":[9648,18],"popularity":13.99,"first_air_date":"2018-10-12","vote_average":8.112,"vote_count":2407,"origin_country":["US"]},{"backdrop_path":"/a906PH7CDmSOdS7kmnAgdWk5mhv.jpg","id":67744,"name":"MINDHUNTER","original_name":"MINDHUNTER","overview":"An agent in the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit develops profiling techniques as he pursues notorious serial killers and rapists.","poster_path":"/fbKE87mojpIETWepSbD5Qt741fp.jpg","media_type":"tv","adult":false,"original_language":"en","genre_ids":[18,80],"popularity":17.4262,"first_air_date":"2017-10-13","vote_average":8.082,"vote_count":2593,"origin_country":["US"]},{"backdrop_path":"/dg3OindVAGZBjlT3xYKqIAdukPL.jpg","id":42009,"name":"Black Mirror","original_name":"Black Mirror","overview":"Twisted tales run wild in this mind-bending anthology series that reveals humanity's worst traits, greatest innovations and more.","poster_path":"/seN6rRfN0I6n8iDXjlSMk1QjNcq.jpg","media_type":"tv","adult":false,"original_language":"en","genre_ids":[10765,18,9648],"popularity":140.4353,"first_air_date":"2011-12-04","vote_average":8.291,"vote_count":5441,"origin_country":["GB"]},{"backdrop_path":"/A6I3M4MIA2Pi2gS6vGdg2eVlVXT.jpg","id":68421,"name":"Altered Carbon","original_name":"Altered Carbon","overview":"After 250 years on ice, a prisoner returns to life in a new body with one chance to win his freedom: by solving a mind-bending murder.","poster_path":"/66rKwpSexUZ3yTv5lBS1bjU4Ykk.jpg","media_type":"tv","adult":false,"original_language":"en","genre_ids":[10765,18],"popularity":13.5389,"first_air_date":"2018-02-02","vote_average":7.664,"vote_count":2011,"origin_country":["US"]},{"backdrop_path":"/xGexTKCJDkl12dTW4YCBDXWb1AD.jpg","id":71446,"name":"Money Heist","original_name":"La casa de papel","overview":"To carry out the biggest heist in history, a mysterious man called The Professor recruits a band of eight robbers who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose.
