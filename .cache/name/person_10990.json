{"details":{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Emma Vatsone"],"biography":"Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990) is an English actress and activist. She has gained recognition for her roles in both blockbusters and independent films, as well as her women's rights work. Watson has been ranked among the world's highest-paid actresses by Forbes and Vanity Fair, and was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2015.\n\nWatson attended the Dragon School and trained in acting at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts. As a child, she rose to stardom after landing her first professional acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series, having acted only in school plays previously. Watson also starred in the 2007 television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes and lent her voice to The Tale of Despereaux (2008). After the final Harry Potter film, she took on a supporting role in My Week with Marilyn (2011), before starring as Sam, a flirtatious, free-spirited student in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) to critical success.\n\nFurther acclaim came from portraying Alexis Neiers in Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring (2013) and the titular character's adoptive daughter in the biblical epic Noah. That same year, Watson was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, winning British Artist of the Year. She also starred as Belle in the musical romantic fantasy Beauty and the Beast (2017), which ranks among the highest-grossing films of all time, and Meg March in the coming-of-age drama Little Women (2019).\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014, Watson split her time between working on films and continuing her education, graduating from Brown University with a bachelor's degree in English literature in May 2014. That year, she was appointed a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which advocates for gender equality. In 2018, she helped launch Time's Up UK as a founding member. Watson was appointed to a G7 advisory body for women's rights in 2019, consulting with leaders on foreign policy. Her modelling work has included campaigns for Burberry and Lancôme. She also lent her name to a clothing line for the sustainable brand People Tree. In 2020, she joined the board of directors of Kering, a luxury brand group, in her capacity as an advocate for sustainable fashion.","birthday":"1990-04-15","deathday":null,"gender":1,"homepage":null,"id":10990,"imdb_id":"nm0914612","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Watson","place_of_birth":"Paris, France","popularity":22.2613,"profile_path":"/A14lLCZYDhfYdBa0fFRpwMDiwRN.jpg"},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/sp7GUxx4kEae1t79BKY7kLldDJb.jpg","genre_ids":[99],"id":1190725,"original_language":"en","original_title":"David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived","overview":"As Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double in the Harry Potter films, David Holmes' work has been seen worldwide by millions of people.

The Saturday edition aired live from 7 to 9 a.m. Eastern Time as well, but a number of affiliates did not carry it or aired it later on tape-delay. It premiered on November 1, 1999, and was the newest of the major networks' morning shows, although CBS has made several attempts to program in the morning slot since 1954. The show aired as a division of CBS News.\n\nThe Early Show, like many of its predecessors, traditionally ran last in the ratings to its rivals, NBC's Today and ABC's Good Morning America. Much like NBC's The Today Show and The Tonight Show, the title The Early Show was analogous to that of CBS's late-night talk show, The Late Show.","popularity":18.74,"poster_path":"/iJvwr7kL0Q7BtrYC38KQ5baPw7g.jpg","name":"The Early Show","vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60c574147a97ab0070124f69","episode_count":1,"media_type":"tv","release_date":"1999-11-01"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/kCcH5XGInPxDuhwfZJUBUFb0JUi.jpg","genre_ids":[10763,10767],"id":42265,"origin_country":["DE"],"original_language":"de","original_name":"Taff","overview":"Taff is a tabloid news magazine airing on the German television network, ProSieben.","popularity":202.5649,"poster_path":"/2XJlnWPmoNLuaa85ol8Xe3GXYVm.jpg","name":"Taff","vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"5fd6cbfff36a32003e707ab5","episode_count":1,"media_type":"tv","release_date":"1997-03-11"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/wYTv1Zy3WFNi63lxwpBQ61Yrgj0.jpg","genre_ids":[35],"id":2767,"origin_country":["GB"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"The Vicar of Dibley","overview":"Reverend Granger is assigned as the Vicar of the rural parish of Dibley, but she is not quite what the villagers expected.","popularity":15.6498,"poster_path":"/oSMljUndA07O8eMCSwaal4kcWoq.jpg","name":"The Vicar of Dibley","vote_average":7.335,"vote_count":94,"character":"Reverend Iris","credit_id":"61ad7fba6840cc0042983e23","episode_count":1,"media_type":"tv","release_date":"1994-11-10"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/zu2vKWoIwdLN8raXNDASmTpawi6.jpg","genre_ids":[],"id":13667,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"MTV Movie & TV Awards","overview":"The annual film & TV awards show presented by MTV.
